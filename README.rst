Photobooth
====================
I created this app to use at my wedding. It was run on a Raspberry Pi with a small computer screen and a Canon 60d.

Under the hood
-----------------------
Under the hood, the technologies used are:

- Raspberry Pi GPIO pins
- `Tkinter` for the Window of the app
- `gphoto2` to control the camera
- Flickr to upload the images
- Twillio to send the images
- ImageMagik to convert the images to 'strips'
